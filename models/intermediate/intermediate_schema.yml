  - name: listings_cleansed
    description: The 'listings_cleansed' model is a cleaned version of the 'src_listings' table from the 'AIRBNB.DEV' database. It contains information about Airbnb listings, including the listing ID, name, host ID and name, price, neighbourhood, geographical coordinates (latitude and longitude), room type, minimum nights required for booking, number of reviews, date of the last review, reviews per month, the calculated count of the host's listings, availability over the year, and the number of reviews in the last twelve months. The model handles missing values by replacing null host names with 'Unknown', null prices with 0, null last review dates with '1900-01-01', and null reviews per month with 0.
